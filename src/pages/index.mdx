Looking through this starter (both its files and the web version) you can understand what Chronoblog is and how it can help you create a personal website.

However, most of the information about the work of Chronoblog can be found here in the main repository: [github.com/ganevru/gatsby-theme-chronoblog](https://github.com/Ganevru/gatsby-theme-chronoblog)
