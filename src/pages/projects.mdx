## About site pages

This is the site page. This page could also be called a **portfolio**, or **cases**, or, say, a **contacts**.

The file for **this** page is here: **`src/pages/project.mdx`**

You can change the name of the file to any, this is just an example. The most important thing for a site page is that the site page file must be in the "pages" folder: **`src/pages/`**

## About main menu

In order to add or change a link to a page, you need to go to the "site-header.mdx" file: **`src/gatsby-theme-chronoblog/site-header.mdx`**

Here it looks like this:

```md
<MenuMain>
  <MenuBlock>
    <Link to="/">Home</Link>
    <Link to="/projects">Projects</Link>
  </MenuBlock>
  <MenuBlock>
    <LightDarkSwitchButton darkLabel="🌙" lightLabel="☀️" />
  </MenuBlock>
</MenuMain>
```

The file explains itself. Here, for example, is the option without a link to this page:

```md
<MenuMain>
  <MenuBlock>
    <Link to="/">Home</Link>
  </MenuBlock>
  <MenuBlock>
    <LightDarkSwitchButton darkLabel="🌙" lightLabel="☀️" />
  </MenuBlock>
</MenuMain>
```

Or only with a link to the main page:

```md
<MenuMain>
  <MenuBlock>
    <Link to="/">Home</Link>
  </MenuBlock>
</MenuMain>
```

## About `FeedItems` component

**`FeedItems`** component shows feed with posts, links and notes - in the form of cards.

To just show the content of the site, it is enough to use this component in this way (as it is used on the main page of the site):

```jsx
<FeedItems />
```

But on this page, this component uses the **`filterByTags`** argument, which takes an array of tags:

```jsx
<FeedItems filterByTags={['project']} />
```

In this case, the feed shows only materials that have the tag "project".

This can be useful if you want to use this page only, for example, to display your portfolio, or to display only articles on a specific topic.

<FeedItems filterByTags={['project']} />
